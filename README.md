# BRIEF OVERVIEW
A revisit to my labor of love, Dad Lives TTW. This new revamp adds a companion quest using AI voice acting, more things for Dad to talk about/comment on, removes dirty edits, fixes bugs, and generally just improves upon the original mod.

If you haven't used the original mod, Dad Lives TTW is a mod that alters Fallout 3's story, so Dad survives Project Purity. It was made at the request of EvanIsCool, who has helped me test many of my mods. Dad can be found at Raven Rock during "The American Dream" and if you load an existing file with that completed or you miss him, he will be at The Citadel.

# ALL CHANGES FROM THE ORIGINAL MOD
- Dad now has a companion quest (Requires the Capital Wasteland's MQ to be completed)
- Over 30 new lines of dialogue to have more things to talk to Dad about and decrease repetitive conversations
- Dad now doesn't count toward the follower limit, reducing the chance of bugs occurring related to it
- Most scripts were revamped, some being entirely redone
- JIP CCC compatibility finally works as intended
- Fixed crashes when training Dad's skills
- Dad is not weighed down by items he can't remove from his inventory
